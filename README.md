# HydroMetrix: Web-Based Water Optimization System with Automatic Refill for Apartments

### This study aims at enhancing water management practices in the apartment buildings due to high population and usage of water. Current systems lack sufficient granularity to face water consumption or inspire people to conserve water, which results in their wastage.
HydroMetrix has a smarter take on the situation with a real-time Internet of Things system that tracks water consumption of each apartment. It can be used for water leakage detection, usage monitoring, and management to ensure rational utilization. In addressing this demand, HydroMetrix contributes to environmental conservation by minimizing the wastage of water while assisting the planet in achieving conservation goals for sustainable living

## These materials and hardware have been carefully selected to ensure our system operates efficiently and looks great.

## This is how we monitor the tank: We use sensors to keep track of the tank levels in real-time, so we can easily see and respond to any changes

## The YF-S201 Flow Sensor (Dataq part number 2000362) allows Dataq Instruments data acquisition and data logger units to acquire flow rate (L/sec) information. The combination of these two products provides a compact solution, with sensor excitation provided by the data logger.
